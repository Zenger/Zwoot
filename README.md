Zwoot
=====

A wordpress Framework for faster Web Development
There is a working plan at zwoot.Project.Plan.txt which you can read.

Zwoot stands for
	[Z]enger(ME) [W]bx(CO-Author) [Ut]ilities

To give you an ideea of what the framework tends to be:

1. It will provide you with all the tools to start building a template in any of these forms :
	a) Plugin
	b) Theme
	c) Child Theme
	d) Set of libraries
2. It will pre-define all the needing data you need to start a theme
	a) Widgets
	b) Sidebars
	c) Navmenus
	d) Galeries
	e) Custom post types
	f) Multilanguage and Seo
		Note: I don't like the current language plugins, and WPML is not opensource
	g) Navigation (Like WP-Pagenavi)
	
3. Zwoot tends to be a set of libraries which will enhance your theme building alot

What Zwoot will not be :

1. Zwoot will always be free and I will never charge you for using it . (LGPL/BSD/MIT/APACHE2) - I'm not sure yet (have suggestions, write me)
2. An Option-Tree alike plugin or like any other plugin , I want to make the best from the word "Framework"

Thank you, now all it's left is to finish the project.
